    "These blog posts are likely going to come as I hit moments of coding apathy, or just don't get the time in the day to update any code. It gives me an opportunity to sort of stop and think about what's going on as I progress and perhaps evaluate the path a little before moving forward.",
    "This time, the stop comes because I'm a little stumped on the most current The Odin Project ... project. That's a little weird to say, isn't it? I'm on the Tic Tac Toe project which wants to use modules and functions to keep as much out of the global scope as possible. I'm struggling with what goes where and how to write it. But classes and elements similar to that I've always struggled with.",
    "Other things I've struggled with are functions, testing, and recursion. Although functions and recursion I'm getting more of a handle on. Testing I'm sure isn't far behind that. So I still have a lot to learn in general, but I've only been putting in serious learning effort within the last year.",
    "I did finish at least one coding thing today, even if it didn't go up on GitHub. I completed Google's course: \"Automating Real-World Tasks with Python\" on Coursera. It was very interesting and I'm looking forward to using some of the things I learned."

      "I think I have been a little all over the place in my journey. I started back in 2014 learning bits of R, SQL, and Python when I did my started my graduate studies in Data Analytics. I very much enjoyed Python so I continued to learn more and try to use it in my own individual projects.",
      "I worked with a few different online resources like <a href='www.freecodecamp.org/'>freecodecamp</a> (where some of my projects came from) and <a href='www.codecademy.com/'>codeacademy</a>. I felt like both do a lot of hand holding and for me that wasn't conducive to solid learning. I also did coding challenges like the one on <a href='www.codewars.com'>codewars</a> and the <a href='www.adventofcode.com'>Advent of Code</a>. It also took me three seperate attempts (and one stay-at-home order) to complete CS50.",
      "At this point, I'm now working through <a href='www.theodinproject.com'>The Odin Project</a>. I am finding it much more hands off which I am liking. I have to do a lot more research to find answers I need and as a result I am learning a lot more.",
      "My goal this year is to get something up every day, this little blog is today's item and it feels like cheating. I've been doing other programming stuff so it doesn't feel like the worst I guess?"

      "Working from home certainly makes it easier. It’s nice to take a break from work and work on little side things, experiment with code, etc. When you have to go in to work and your work is not coding related that ability goes away. You then have to find the energy/focus/will to continue on into the evening.",
      "There just isn’t enough time in the day. My goal was to code every day, even if it was a tiny thing. I was going to track that via Git commits on GitHub.",
      "Some days are better than others, so far as of this posting I’ve only missed a single day at the very beginning of the year. However, it hasn’t all been great. There have certainly been days where I felt like I “cheated” like today and just wrote a blog post. Although, on some of these days I was at least practicing on FreeCodeCamp or reading articles.",
      "It made me wonder if my goal was to ambitious for a novice like myself. I know that practice is what improves a skill and just putting “pen to paper” so to speak is important. I struggle with imposter syndrome in my day job, so why wouldn’t it mentally extend this far as well?",
      "If someone stumbles upon this blog, then at least they might see that they are not alone if they are also struggling. If they aren’t struggling … well I hope they don’t laugh to much."
