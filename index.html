    <p>This is the beginning of my page.</p>
    <p>My plan is to slowly improve upon this website as I learn and become better
    at front end development.</p>
    <p>As of 1/5/21, this page is being hosted via Github Pages. Per the README file
    my goals for starting this project are as followed:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Use github on a daily basis</li>
        <li>Have a place where I journal about my journey into development</li>
        <li>Do a little coding, be it python or web, a little everyday</li>
        <li>Have a project to give additional purpose to my learning</li>
    </ol>
