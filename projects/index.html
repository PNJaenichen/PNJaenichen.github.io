        <p id='intro'>My name is Nate and I am learning front end web design. I 
            have a BS in history from USNA and a MS in Data Analytics from UMGC. 
            I started this journey during the COVID-19 crises in 2020. I focused 
            first on Harvard's CS50 course which at this point I am still working 
            on.</p>
