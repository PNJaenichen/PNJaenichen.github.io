// 'todos' are bojects that can be dynamically created

/* TODO create factory or constructors/classes to generate. Can have whatever 
properties you want, but at a minimum: title, description, dueDate, and
priority. Could also include notes or checklist */

/* TODO have projects or seperate lists of todos with a default when the 
page is brought up */

/* application logic should be seperate from DOM related items, so seperate
 modules */

/* TODO Interface should be able to do the following: 
    view all projects
    view all todos in each project (perhaps different colors based on pri)
    expand a single todo to see/edit its details
    delete a todo
*/

// use localStorage to save user's projects and todos between sessions
