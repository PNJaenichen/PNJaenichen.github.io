                <span class='bold'>Lewis Burwell "Chesty" Puller</span> (June 26, 
                1898 â€“ October 11, 1971) served as a United States Marine Corps 
                officer. Beginning his career fighting guerillas in Haiti and 
                Nicaragua as part of the Banana Wars, he later served with 
                distinction in World War II and the Korean War as a senior officer. 
                By the time of his retirement in 1955, he had reached the rank 
                of lieutenant general.
            </p>
            <p>
                Puller is the most decorated Marine in American history. He is 
                one of two United States servicemen to be awarded five Navy 
                Crosses and one Army Distinguished Service Cross. Puller's six 
                crosses are next in number to the seven times Eddie Rickenbacker 
                received the nation's second-highest military award for valor.
            </p>
            <p>
                Puller retired from the Marine Corps in 1955, after 37 years of 
                service. He lived in Virginia and died in 1971, at age 73.
