// ROT: if you only need ONE of something (gameBoard, displayController),
// use a module. If you need multiples of something (players!), create
// them with factories

// TODO create player objects

// TODO create game flow object

// TODO Create HTML and JS to render the gameboard array

// TODO Create interface to take and display player name
