                biking or some other form of movement. Commit to a 5k (or 47 
                minutes) of your favorite activity between March 7th and March

                Bethanie Perry is an Assistant Professor of history at Northern 
                Virginia Community College and is passionate not simply about 
                teaching history but making sure her students can have access to 
                the tools and resources that help them overcome their daily challenges 
                outside of the classroom. This movement event began as a brainstorming 
                between sisters on how bP could continue to demonstrate her compassion 
                and energy towards her community.
