                <p>
                    I think I have been a little all over the place in my journey. 
                    I started back in 2014 learning bits of R, SQL, and Python 
                    when I did my started my graduate studies in Data Analytics. 
                    I very much enjoyed Python so I continued to learn more and 
                    try to use it in my own individual projects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with a few different online resources like <a href="www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> 
                    (where some of my projects came from) and <a href="www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a>. 
                    I felt like both do a lot of hand holding and for me that 
                    wasn't conducive to solid learning. I also did coding challenges 
                    like the one on <a href="www.codewars.com">codewars</a> and 
                    the <a href="www.adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. It also
                    took me three seperate attempts (and one stay-at-home order) to 
                    complete CS50.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, I'm now working through <a href="www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.
                    I am finding it much more hands off which I am liking. I have
                    to do a lot more research to find answers I need and as a result
                    I am learning a lot more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal this year is to get something up every day, this little
                    blog is today's item and it feels like cheating. I've been doing
                    other programming stuff so it doesn't feel like the worst I guess?
