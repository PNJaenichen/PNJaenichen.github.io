                <p> 
                    These blog posts are likely going to come as I hit moments 
                    of coding apathy, or just don't get the time in the day to
                    update any code. It gives me an opportunity to sort of stop
                    and think about what's going on as I progress and perhaps 
                    evaluate the path a little before moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This time, the stop comes because I'm a little stumped on 
                    the most current The Odin Project ... project. That's a 
                    little weird to say, isn't it? I'm on the Tic Tac Toe 
                    project which wants to use modules and functions to keep
                    as much out of the global scope as possible. I'm struggling
                    with what goes where and how to write it. But classes and 
                    elements similar to that I've always struggled with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Other things I've struggled with are functions, testing, and 
                    recursion. Although functions and recursion I'm getting more
                    of a handle on. Testing I'm sure isn't far behind that. So 
                    I still have a lot to learn in general, but I've only been
                    putting in serious learning effort within the last year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I did finish at least one coding thing today, even if it 
                    didn't go up on GitHub. I completed Google's course: "Automating
                    Real-World Tasks with Python" on Coursera. It was very interesting
                    and I'm looking forward to using some of the things I learned.

                    I think I have been a little all over the place in my journey. 
                    I started back in 2014 learning bits of R, SQL, and Python 
                    when I did my started my graduate studies in Data Analytics. 
                    I very much enjoyed Python so I continued to learn more and 
                    try to use it in my own individual projects. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I worked with a few different online resources like <a href="www.freecodecamp.org/">freecodecamp</a> 
                    (where some of my projects came from) and <a href="www.codecademy.com/">codeacademy</a>. 
                    I felt like both do a lot of hand holding and for me that 
                    wasn't conducive to solid learning. I also did coding challenges 
                    like the one on <a href="www.codewars.com">codewars</a> and 
                    the <a href="www.adventofcode.com">Advent of Code</a>. It also
                    took me three seperate attempts (and one stay-at-home order) to 
                    complete CS50.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At this point, I'm now working through <a href="www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project</a>.
                    I am finding it much more hands off which I am liking. I have
                    to do a lot more research to find answers I need and as a result
                    I am learning a lot more. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal this year is to get something up every day, this little
                    blog is today's item and it feels like cheating. I've been doing
                    other programming stuff so it doesn't feel like the worst I guess?

                    Working from home certainly makes it easier. It’s nice 
                    to take a break from work and work on little side things, 
                    experiment with code, etc. When you have to go in to 
                    work and your work is not coding related that ability 
                    goes away. You then have to find the energy/focus/will 
                    to continue on into the evening. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    There just isn’t enough time in the day. My goal was 
                    to code every day, even if it was a tiny thing. I was 
                    going to track that via Git commits on GitHub. Some 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some days are better than others, so far as of this 
                    posting I’ve only missed a single day at the very 
                    beginning of the year. However, it hasn’t all been 
                    great. There have certainly been days where I felt 
                    like I “cheated” like today and just wrote a blog post. 
                    Although, on some of these days I was at least practicing 
                    on FreeCodeCamp or reading articles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It made me wonder if my goal was to ambitious for a 
                    novice like myself. I know that practice is what 
                    improves a skill and just putting “pen to paper” so 
                    to speak is important. I struggle with imposter 
                    syndrome in my day job, so why wouldn’t it mentally 
                    extend this far as well? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    If someone stumbles upon this blog, then at least 
                    they might see that they are not alone if they are 
                    also struggling. If they aren’t struggling … well I 
                    hope they don’t laugh to much.</p>
