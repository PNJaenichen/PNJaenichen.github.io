update any code. It gives me an opportunity to sort of stop and think about what's going on as I progress and perhaps evaluate the path a little before moving forward.\",\r\n    \"This time, the stop comes because I'm a little stumped on the most current The Odin Project ... project. That's a little weird to say, isn't it? I'm on the Tic Tac Toe project which wants to use modules and functions to keep as much out of the global scope as possible. I'm struggling with what goes where and how to write it. But classes and elements similar to that I've always struggled with.\",\r\n    \"Other things I've struggled with are functions, testing, and recursion. Although functions and recursion I'm getting more of a handle on. Testing I'm sure isn't far behind that. So I still have a lot to learn in general, but I've only been putting in serious learning effort within the last year.\",\r\n    \"I did finish at least one coding thing today, even if it didn't go up on GitHub.
