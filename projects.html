    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>
        The following projects were created by me while working through 
        various curious as I learn web development. Generally speaking,
        they go in chronological order with my first projects at the top 
        and going down. Hopefully as you scroll you can see a progression
        in skill as sites get better with more practice.

                                    <p>
                                        The project was to build a tribute page with nine <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-tribute-page">user stories</a>.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This was the first website I had built from scratch since I tried
                                        to learn the language back in my geocities days. The page itself
                                        is bare. It meets the requirements of the project but not much
                                        beyond that. My biggest challenge was getting the image to resize
                                        as the window was resized.

                                        The project was to build a survey form with 16 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form">user stories</a>.

                                        This project took a bit more CSS googling, especially to line 
                                        up all the labels with the respective elements. The page itself 
                                        is bland, as it was designed to meet the requirements of the 
                                        project.

                                    <p>
                                        The project was to build a product landing page that had 
                                        15 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page">user stories</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The part I found most difficult about this particular project 
                                        was creating the 'cards' for each of the elements at the 
                                        bottom of the page. This was also my first look at <code>iframe</code>
                                        elements putting the YouTube video in.
                                    </p>
                                </div>
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <input type="radio" id="tab4" name="fccTab">
                    <label class="tabButton" for="tab4">Technical Page</label>
                    <div class="tab">
                        <div class="content">

                                        <iframe src="projects/technical.html" frameborder="0"></iframe>
                                    </div>
                                </div>
                                <div class="right-column">
                                    <a href='projects/technical.html'><strong>Technical Documentation Page</strong></a>
                                    <p>
                                        The project was to build a page with technical documentation
                                        that had 15 <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page">user stories</a>.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This project saw the use of some new HTML elements. I found
                                        the most difficult portion to to be the creation of the 
                                        navigation bar. It is responsive in that on larger screens 
                                        it sits on the left side of the window while on smaller 
                                        screens it shifts to the top. Like the other projects from 
                                        <a href="www.freecodecamp.org">FreeCodeCamp</a> this project 
                                        meets the requirements of the project and is bare after 
                                        that.
                                    </p>

                                        The project was to build replica of the Google homepage. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/foundations/lessons/html-css">Instructions</a>.

                                        This was a nice exercise of HTML and CSS, especially as I was 
                                        getting back into learning front end development. The real 
                                        benefit I found in this project (beyond more practice with 
                                        the code) was the integration of the assignment with GitHub.

                                        The project was to build a website that enabled the user to 
                                        play Rock, Paper, Scissors against a random opponent.

                                        This project shifted the focus from HTML and CSS to javascript.
                                        There were two portions to this exercise, one which used 
                                        the console and then updating it to show everything on the 
                                        page. This was my first attempt at adjusting a pages DOM 
                                        utilizing javascript.

                                        The project was to build a simple calculator that does basic

                                        This one had a few interesting elements. One was the taking
                                        user input and performing the operations required. It took
                                        some figuring out to get it to work like a basic calculator.
                                        One of the other challenges was to make sure that only a 
                                        single decimal was input, which programatically I knew
                                        how to do it, but it took a little with javascript specific
                                        elements in order to get it done.

                                        The project was to build an application where a user could
                                        add and remove books from a 'library' and mark whether they
                                        had been read or not. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/library">Instructions</a>.  
                                    </p>

                                        This is a very plain looking website and could certainly
                                        use a visual uplift. DOM manipulation and Event Listeners
                                        were big in this one. The hardest part was to figure out 
                                        how to create listeners for elements on the page that had 
                                        not been created yet via the script. The other item I 
                                        focused on, was ensuring that the user input went to the 
                                        elements <code>textContent</code> vice <code>innerHTML</code>
                                        to add additional security. Unfortunatly the library is 
                                        not persistent, that would be the next step.

                                    <p>
                                        The goal of this project was to create a site that would  
                                        utilize tabs in order to display information about a restaurant.
                                        The real goal was to utilize webpack and different javascript
                                        modules. <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page">Instructions</a>.  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        The tabs themselves were easy to complete. The Odin Project
                                        provided a page with tons of examples and I just chose the
                                        one I like the most and then used the developers tool to 
                                        learn how it was made. After that creating the modules that
                                        build the DOM for each tab was relatively easy. It took a 
                                        bit of online searching to figure out webpack with multiple
                                        entries but I figured that out as well. I think if I would 
                                        refactor this, it would be to find an better way at creating
                                        the DOM. Especially for the second tab, which repeated itself
                                        tons of times to create each of the elements. I like the 
                                        look of the tabs and I think eventually I wanted to adjust 
                                        this portion of the page to look more like that instead of 
                                        the current layout.

                This project provided more opportunity to adjust a pages
                DOM. I found the reseting and rebuilding the canvas the 
                most difficult and took some work. The actual changing of
                the 'pixels' was new but it was easy enough to figure out
                with a small amount of reading/googling.
